#CartPole-python3-Google Colab

Re-Implementation of already existing cartpole

Step:1

First Clone the repository; it will be stored in /content folder
!git clone https://github.com/gsurma/cartpole.git

Step:2
run the cartpole.py file using following command
!python /content/cartpole/cartpole.py

Notes:

There are some changes that I made in the cartpole.py and score_logger.py file.

These files I have included here.

First in cartpole.py file- line which shows error in print command.
Second in score_logger.py- line which shows error in print command.
Third in score_logger.py- Path of the different score files.
